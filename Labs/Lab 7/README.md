# Lab 7

I want you to be able to connect to a database using MongoDB Connect. So for this lab I want to make sure you do the following:

- Install MongoDB Connect
- Connect to our class database using this uri `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.h6c8l.mongodb.net/test`
    - Replace `<username>` and <password> with `Student` for the username and `CorgisAreDope` for the password
    - Yes it's simple but I want you to understand where things go in the URI
- In the `Lab-7` database under the collection `Students` add a data document with the fields `firstName` and `lastName` then populate those fields with your name. This is how I'll know the lab was done.
- After that you're good! Optional is to sign up for your own MongoDB Atlas account and go and play around!

This lab is another simple one but very crucial. Same as last week it seems simple, I'm relaxing on the instructions to make sure you can determine the minor points that you need to implement to get the points above to work.
