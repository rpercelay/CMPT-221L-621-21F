# Lab 6

I need you to make sure that you understand how to make a post request. So for this lab I want to make sure you do the following:

- Create 2 get routes with forms on them.
- Create 2 post routes to handle the information coming in from the forms.
- Console log the output of these forms on the server side.
- Redirect back to the previous page.

This lab is very simple but very crucial. Also one of the reasons it seems simple is that I'm relaxing on the instructions to make sure you can determine the minor points that you need to implement to get the points above to work.
