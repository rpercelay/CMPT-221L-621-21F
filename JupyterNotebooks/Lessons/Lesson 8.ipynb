    "So far we've been making webpages and we probably have some elements that repeat here and there. When this happens similar to writing code in any of our other languages we'd like to stay DRY. This makes it so that if we need to make changes to something that repeats we only have to do it in one place. We can do this through the use of something called a partial. This is\n",
    "\n",
    "Partials are basically a way to have a repeatable portion of HTML that we can place into other HTML pages. While this is possible in regular HTML, EJS is going to make this a whole lot easier. So far we haven't delved too deep into using the JavaScript parts of EJS but that changes today with partials!\n",

    "## Router\n",
    "Router is something that we're already familiar with believe it or not. The idea of using the router is a little bit trickier to wrap your head around though! All we're doing is making it so that we can easily break out our routes into more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we mainly need to know about something named `module.exports`. This allows us to be able to pass things between JS files on the server side. In our case we're going to be passing our routes and later in the lesson our DB models.\n",

    "Similar to our partials above we're just going to make our routes accessible across more manageable parts.\n",

    "let blogRoutes = require('./routes/blog');\n",

    "So this is another one of the things that I want to show you BUT you DEFINITELY DON'T have to use! This\n",
    "\n",
    "Swagger is something that was introduced to me in the workplace and is an invaluable tool when making more complex APIs. This 100% could be considered overkill for our class and would take some time to learn completely (it still confuses me). Essentially this tool makes it so that we can design and build our API before writing any code. This turns our API into a design first way of doing things. Swagger makes this worth your while by adding some freebies into the mix for you. It gives you the ability to look at and try out your routes as well as generate the API code without you having to do anything. You will have to write code to add in your functionality but you get the code files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're probably wondering why we don't just do this. This is where the overkill part comes in. You're going to be exposed to A LOT of new files and code that you didn't write and to sift through all of that to figure out what it does will take time. If you'd like to go this route it's ok but I personally wouldn't advise it for this project based on the time that we have left in the semester.\n",

    "## MongoDB Install\n",
    "Ok, so we have a few options here, one of them makes the most sense in the end game of it all but the others are good for development purposes but it means that everyone on your team would have a separate database to manage. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can either install databases locally for all members of your team. This makes it so that you'll all need to have some knowledge of what to do with your website and database. This isn't the worst option but it makes it a little bit more complicated if you have data that you want to keep in your database for your final demo or want to share with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next option technically isn't an install at all. We've talked about the cloud as a side conversation but we could also foray into it as well. This would make it so that you have one instance that you need to manage across your team. You just run the risk of accidentally putting in bad information into your database. You have this risk no matter what though. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all of that being said as we've said a bunch of times databases aren't a part of this course but playing with data is so we won't stress the DB part. Personally I just think it's cooler to have some knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to choose I think that I'd go the cloud route. There's only 1 DB to manage vs 5 and when we talk about modeling we protect ourself from a lot of the complexities that'd make our databases difficult to deal with.\n",

    "MongoDB Compass is going to be our way to circumvent having to bring you all into the terminal and making things difficult by having to learn more commands and what not. MongoDB Compass is designed for us to be able to visualize our data and run queries on the fly without being connected to an application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be essential for you guys as you play with MongoDB. Personally I think it's a lot easier to understand the data when you can see it. Plus this should be a solution that spans all of the operating system. \n",

    "\n",
    "Making it's return, Mongoose Connect is what's going to allow us to connect to the database servers that we just talked about in the previous 2 sections. The connection piece here is easy but we'll also go into making models for your data as well as storing and retrieving your data using mongoose. First we need to understand URIs which some also call URLs but is called a connection string in Mongo. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that I'd rather you learn about URI/URLs is that you can learn the why rather than what. So in our case we need a connections string that's likely going to look something like this. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now this can be longer or shorter depending on if you have credentials for your DB. Which you should have in the real world. For class I don't think it matters. I also haven't tried connecting using Atlas yet just as a disclaimer. (We'll see in a moment though)\n",

    "\n",
    "When we put all of these pieces together we get out URL/URI and can connect to our DB using mongoose!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need to use our connection string in our server file. It'll look something like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "`mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/sd2_demo', {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useFindAndModify: false, useCreateIndex: true});`\n",
