What now? Well how do we get other people to see it? How do we actually deploy a website so that it's visible on the internet? What do we need, who do we contact? What actually is godaddy.com?

    "Ok so the domain name service, this is basically a massive phone book for the internet. Humans are dumb. We use words and names to identify things. Although we all have ID numbers, we probably couldn't say them if we tried. Computers are good with numbers so they're ok with a unique identifier. This is where the government comes in. The government has a database that connects an ID number to your name so that others can know who you are and differentiate you if you don't have a unique name. \n",

    "The DNS is the government of the internet in this scenario. We speak in words and remember names. Computers on the other hand remember numbers.

    "So this is probably the most difficult of all of the options. Not difficult because it's challenging, but difficult because you have to own a server capable of hosting all of the hits to your website, that you also have to protect from hackers and what not. So on and so forth. With a personal server you take on the responsibility of all of the hardware aspects of it as well and that's just the beginning. This is worth for someone with the money and know how but may be a little advanced for now. We\n",

Most importantly, you don't have to buy a domain for this option. You have the possibility of getting a link from them but it will be running with heroku somewhere in the name. Small trade off for somewhat free hosting. Now this won't be up all the time but again trade offs.\n",

I personally use AWS for my website and rent out a VM from them every month. They also have other options like Elastic Beanstalk where you don't manage your own VM. The point here is that AWS is tried and true. You can also get a free tier with them but this will give you an IP rather than a URL. You then would take that IP and register it with your domain name provider.\n",

    "Ok so there's no issue with being top 2. There is a problem when you're the clear #2 in that top two. So behind AWS you have Azure. I hear that Azure is a phenomenal platform that can give you a lot of the same functionality and benefits that AWS gives you. Realistically the big difference here is that AWS got there first and is know as THE cloud provider now. Honestly, nowadays all of the cloud providers are catching up with one another when it comes to the things that they offerer and are more differentiated by the experience using them. Azure, has a good one! So worth checking out if you wanna try something other than AWS.\n",

So similar to Microsoft with Azure, Google was just a step behind AWS and is seen by a lot as #3 in the cloud battle for position. The interface is very google and similar to their typical ascetic. You shouldn't have many issues with this one either. \n",

Well the IBM cloud is what happens when you start a lot after those 3 and now need an edgy or cool thing to make you stand out from the rest ðŸ˜‚. So the IBM cloud is totally usable by consumers at the public level but typically spends it's focus marketing to larger companies. That being said the IBM Cloud isn't the best on this list in my opinion but is one that's worth looking into from an experience perspective. \n",

    "So these 2 (and I lumped them together for our collective sanity) are capable of doing a lot for us. And speaking for me their things that I don't particularly want to pay attention to like load balancing and keeping my site fast and accessible. These two are helping us speak with the outside world as we allow strangers to get to our site. They set up policies that only allow certain people and types of traffic to have access to your servers. While dealing with the communication and protocols that have to do with certificates and security standards."

These actually mainly give a way to track down the owner of a site provided something goes wrong. If you don't have a web certificate and try and go without one a web browser will typically say hey this website seems shady and will actually stop you from going to it. This is embedded in your web page and is used by your webserver when people connect to your webpage. "
