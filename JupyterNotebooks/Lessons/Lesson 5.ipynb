    "## DOM Manipulation\n",
    "Last week before we left we talked about DOM manipulation. DOM manipulation is super important because it allows us to touch things on our pages and change them. After all Javascript was so cool initially because it allowed us to change these static web pages that we actually have into dynamic ones. Before we can do this we need to understand the idea of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before we dive in there are two other pieces of the puzzle that we're not really going to touch but do need to be aware of and that is the _**Navigator**_ & the _**Window**_\n",
    "\n",
    "From Mozilla's Web Documentation [Mozilla Doc on Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document):\n",
    "> The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The DOM tree includes elements such as \\<body\\> and \\<table\\>, among many others. It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that this concept is so important is because it literally the beginning of half of what we're going to do when touching the page. I don't mean that figuratively. \n",
    "\n",
    "`document` is typically how we're going to start off grabbing things on the page. We're probably going to start off using `document.querySelector()` a lot to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we do this we can grab HTML elements. Store them in variables, add event listeners to them, and a lot more! This is the beginning of a lot of cool stuff to come with JavaScript!"

    "## Client Side JavaScript\n",
    "For the most part when we're talking Client side javascript we're typically doing a couple things mainly. The first is DOM manipulation which we've already talked about. The second is a little more complex than that. Before we can take the deep dive into manipulating things with it we need to understand what it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard of the term _**API**_ before. _**Does anyone know what it is or what it does?**_\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs originated in the 40s and were originally and still currently used as a way to connect computers and/or computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said by Wikipedia:\n",
    ">It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright we can talk to other computers. _**Why is that exciting?**_\n",
    "\n",
    "Well for us this unlocks a lot of potential. The further and further time goes on. The more and more APIs that get created. We can utilize these APIs in our web pages. Then to make matters even better. We can start to create our own! We'll come back to that later though!\n",
    "\n",
    "To use API's we have a few different options. For now we're going to talk about 2. The first is how you'll connect through your client side JS in the form of `fetch()`\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to use fetch I have to teach you a couple things really quick! The first is something called a callback function. Callback functions are often used as ways to have your code make decisions based on the information they get back from something. Now they can be really cool but a little confusing. They're also really dangerous as you can easily end up in something referred to only as Callback Hell. This also gets us into promises, but for now we're just going to leave it as \"the thing being called promises to return something back to where it was called from... eventually...\"\n",

    "\n",
    "[Callback Hell Example](http://callbackhell.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing that I want you to see is something called an arrow function and to talk about that we need to talk about Function Expressions. Arrow functions aren't the most important to be able to use but you need to know what they are just in case you see them you won't be lost.\n",

From here on, when talking from the server side, JavaScript will be our server that helps us serve and navigate between different web pages.

We can start to have information change dependent on the person logged in, their preferences, the time of day, so on and so forth. \n",
