    "## NPM installs and using libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that we need to get comfortable with is using NPM to install things. We talked about NPM being a package manager but we didn't take a deep look into it. Today we'll do that a little!\n",
    "\n",
    "So akin to Python project and applications that we write will often use a variety of libraries. Some are pretty standard while others are just silly! For learning purposes today we're going to play with a silly library and talk about managing our packages that become a part of our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "For installation in npm things are pretty simple. We do have to use our terminal though. When you install Node a majority of the time you'll get NPM as well. The first thing that we'll want to do is open the terminal and type in NPM. Those that installed through anaconda you'll wanna open the anaconda prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there we can check if NPM is present by typing `npm` and hitting enter. You're probably going to get something that looks like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm <command>\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "npm install        install all the dependencies in your project\n",
    "npm install <foo>  add the <foo> dependency to your project\n",
    "npm test           run this project's tests\n",
    "npm run <foo>      run the script named <foo>\n",
    "npm <command> -h   quick help on <command>\n",
    "npm -l             display usage info for all commands\n",
    "npm help <term>    search for help on <term>\n",
    "npm help npm       more involved overview\n",
    "\n",
    "All commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    access, adduser, audit, bin, bugs, cache, ci, completion,\n",
    "    config, dedupe, deprecate, diff, dist-tag, docs, doctor,\n",
    "    edit, exec, explain, explore, find-dupes, fund, get, help,\n",
    "    hook, init, install, install-ci-test, install-test, link,\n",

    "    pkg, prefix, profile, prune, publish, rebuild, repo,\n",
    "    restart, root, run-script, search, set, set-script,\n",
    "    shrinkwrap, star, stars, start, stop, team, test, token,\n",
    "    uninstall, unpublish, unstar, update, version, view, whoami\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify configs in the ini-formatted file:\n",
    "    /Users/kippins/.npmrc\n",
    "or on the command line via: npm <command> --key=value\n",
    "\n",
    "More configuration info: npm help config\n",
    "Configuration fields: npm help 7 config\n",
    "\n",
    "npm@7.20.6 /Users/kippins/.nvm/versions/node/v10.22.0/lib/node_modules/npm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what's called a usage prompt and isn't unique to Node but is something that most good CLI tools have. This is basically a help prompt and tells you what your options are. What it also tells you is that NPM is installed. If you get an error instead somethings up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we're all good there we can install 3 things that we're going to need for the rest of the lesson. First we can do a single install.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install ejs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "EJS is an HTML templating language that stands for Embedded JavaScript. We're going to use this to show how we could eventually put data into our webpages and make them more dynamic. So this way of installing things is pretty standard. The only thing about installing things this was is that it's installing things locally. That isn't an issue but for some of our packages if we use them a bunch we can use the next method to install it globally on your system! We can do this by adding `-g` the g stands for global!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install -g express\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Express is the web server that we saw in the last class. We're going to play with that a bit more in a second. This way you may run into an error depending on the permissions of your user. Basically meaning that personally, my user has admin access. If you don't the command above may give you an error and you may need to add `sudo` in front of it. Making the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo npm install -g express\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo` stands for super user do. This basically tells your computer you know what you're doing and to just listen to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally and probably the most important is the addition of the save command. To do that we need `--save` in front of the libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install --save cat-me\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most important because it's going to introduce us to our `node-modules` folder and out `packages.json` file. These are great for development and allow you to share libraries quickly. Similar to `requirements.txt` in python it manages all of your packages but does it A LOT better. If you were to add a new developer to your project you could just tell them to use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will go to the `packages.json` and install everything in there. Now we can also install specific versions and do a lot more but for now this is all that we need!\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: You can also do everything that we did together in one command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install -g --save express ejs cat-me\n",

    "## Express (cont.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last class we saw express and know what it does now so we can learn the basics of how to use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Express as we saw the last time is a way to start a web server. It also handles a lot more than just the running of a web server. It also handles the routing and can even handle template rendering with a bunch of popular templating languages or schemes. We're going to talk about one of the templating languages in a second. For now we want to be able to get a running server and send something to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to remember that express is a server side js application. So we can now use the packages that we just installed in a different way than loading them through our HTML. We now have the `require()` function. This will search your node libraries for the things that you've installed to your system. With that we can import a couple of the things that we installed a second ago!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let express = require('express');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next it's important to realize that we just got an instance of that package into our application. A lot of the time you'll have initialize it in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let app = express();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here I wanna talk about our options. First we're going to discuss routing at a basic level. When reaching out on the internet or to APIs a lot of the time we're going to be making `GET` requests. A get request is as the name implies and says that you're reaching out to grab something. In our case it's a webpage. This can also be to APIs for content like we did last class for our RandomUser example with fetch. The reason that this is important is that it's one of the pieces of our `REST` routing. We're going to talk more on `REST` routing later. For now `GET` is what we can use to tell the server to serve web pages when we see certain things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n",
    "    res.send(\"Hello\");\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So a few things are important to notice here. First is the `\"/\"`. This is telling express that if the url is ever `\"/\"` this is what you're going to do. The next is the variables `req` and `res`. `req` stands for request and typically is holding information that was sent to the browser to the server. `res` is response and has methods that you'll typically alter to respond back to the web browser. Now if we remember from the last class we just get text on a webpage when we do what we have above. This is cool but we've been working to get our web development skills up so we want to render a page instead. To do that we can use the code below but we're going to jump to EJS to actually talk about the rendering part. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app.get(\"/landing\", function(req, res) {\n",
    "    res.render(\"landing\");\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n"

    "## EJS\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we can actually cater our webpages to our user. For now we're going to use EJS. There are other templating languages that we can use and that you can use if you'd like! Just know that I'm well versed in EJS and may not be able to help the best with the others but I'll learn with you if you'd like to choose another. [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) is very popular! (I don't know it but would learn!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok that stuff aside! EJS is going to allow us to send data to our webpages and then instead of using `HTML` pages we can use `EJS` pages that will have JavaScript in them. That way we can manipulate data using JS and have it be formatted inside our HTML. This will make more sense in action. Before we move on though. To use this in our server file we need to tell express. To do that we'd add the following line.\n",
