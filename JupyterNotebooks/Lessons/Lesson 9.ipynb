    "\n",
    "MVC is a way to think of manipulating your webpage in a more organized manner. A more modularized manner. When we think about our page we have a portion that deals with data. We have a portion that the user can see. Then we also have a portion that we can use to manipulate things. Now the purpose of MVC is to acknowledge that and give them roles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with the data is the job of the model. This deals with the interaction between the user and the data. How should the data be interpreted? How should it be managed? How should it be manipulated? These are all things that we manage with the models. We want our data controls in the same place. For MVC that's models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is the easiest, the views. We know that for a web page there's typically something to look at. That for us is our webpage, but thinking about what it's responsible for is important. We need to provide the user with an interface to see the current state of the data and page. We need to visualize what's going on and well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have the controller. This is a piece that makes our lives easier. It's not immediately visible, but this is where we come up with our controls. This paired with our view are the parts that people would touch. If the interface for your website sucks and the interface sucks then no one is going to want to use it. This is responsible for the knobs on your site. These are your buttons, these are your checkboxes, this is what you use to manipulate your webpage. "

    "Remember Java? Remember having to type things. Having the best time being granular and making sure the world knows that you know all of your data types. Well now we can do that in Javascript ðŸ˜‚\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok jokes aside. That's at a very high level what Typescript does. Personally I think that Typescript brings Javascript up from what is viewed as a beginners programming language to a more serious programming language. We have the ability to use Javascript, but also have the advantages of checking that a lot of the stricter or more established languages have."
